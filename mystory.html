    Space. A planet. With an iron-based core causing two differentiated
    magnetic poles.

    A race of travelers. Powerful energetic beings capable of creating
    matter out of thin air. Just by thought. Separate beings yet part
    of one grand consciousness.

    Once, this energetic beings, while visiting different stars systems
    and planets, found themselves *trapped* in this earthy magnetic
    planet from which they will have to thrive in order to get out of
    and continue their journey.

    This new adaptation of them is a fleshy biological machine, as
    advanced as themselves in energy form. Yet they've forgotten
    who they were. They know nothing of their powers. They are
    starting to learn how operate this machines.

    And that's us. xD
